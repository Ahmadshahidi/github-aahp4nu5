# Advanced Statistical Methods

Welcome to advanced statistical analysis! This section covers sophisticated techniques used in modern data science and research.

## Multivariate Analysis

When dealing with multiple variables simultaneously, we need advanced techniques to understand relationships and patterns.

### Multiple Linear Regression

Extends simple linear regression to multiple predictors:

**Model**: y = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₚxₚ 
$y=\beta_1x_1+\epsilon$ 

**Key Concepts**:
- **Adjusted R²**: Accounts for the number of predictors
- **Multicollinearity**: When predictors are highly correlated
- **Variable Selection**: Choosing the best subset of predictors

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Reduces dimensionality while preserving variance:

**Applications**:
- Data visualization
- Noise reduction
- Feature extraction
- Compression

**Steps**:
1. Standardize the data
2. Compute covariance matrix
3. Find eigenvalues and eigenvectors
4. Select principal components
5. Transform the data

## Advanced Hypothesis Testing

### ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)

Compares means across multiple groups:

**One-Way ANOVA**: Tests if group means are equal
- H₀: μ₁ = μ₂ = ... = μₖ
- H₁: At least one mean is different

**Two-Way ANOVA**: Tests effects of two factors
- Main effects
- Interaction effects

### Non-Parametric Tests

When data doesn't meet parametric assumptions:

**Mann-Whitney U Test**: Non-parametric alternative to t-test
**Kruskal-Wallis Test**: Non-parametric alternative to ANOVA
**Chi-Square Test**: Tests independence of categorical variables

## Regression Diagnostics

### Assumptions of Linear Regression

1. **Linearity**: Relationship between X and Y is linear
2. **Independence**: Observations are independent
3. **Homoscedasticity**: Constant variance of residuals
4. **Normality**: Residuals are normally distributed

### Diagnostic Plots

**Residual Plots**: Check for patterns in residuals
**Q-Q Plots**: Assess normality of residuals
**Leverage Plots**: Identify influential observations
**Cook's Distance**: Measure influence of individual points

## Advanced Modeling Techniques

### Logistic Regression

For binary outcomes:

**Model**: log(p/(1-p)) = β₀ + β₁x₁ + ... + βₚxₚ

**Interpretation**:
- Odds ratios
- Predicted probabilities
- Classification accuracy

### Poisson Regression

For count data:

**Model**: log(λ) = β₀ + β₁x₁ + ... + βₚxₚ

**Applications**:
- Number of events in a time period
- Rare disease occurrences
- Website clicks

### Survival Analysis

Analyzes time-to-event data:

**Kaplan-Meier Estimator**: Non-parametric survival curves
**Cox Proportional Hazards**: Semi-parametric regression
**Log-Rank Test**: Compares survival curves

## Regularization Techniques

### Ridge Regression (L2)

Adds penalty term: λΣβᵢ²

**Benefits**:
- Reduces overfitting
- Handles multicollinearity
- Shrinks coefficients toward zero

### Lasso Regression (L1)

Adds penalty term: λΣ|βᵢ|

**Benefits**:
- Feature selection
- Sparse solutions
- Automatic variable selection

### Elastic Net

Combines Ridge and Lasso:
- α controls mix of L1 and L2 penalties
- Balances feature selection and grouping

## Model Selection and Validation

### Cross-Validation

**k-Fold CV**: Divide data into k folds
**Leave-One-Out CV**: Special case where k = n
**Stratified CV**: Maintains class proportions

### Information Criteria

**AIC (Akaike Information Criterion)**:
AIC = 2k - 2ln(L)

**BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion)**:
BIC = k·ln(n) - 2ln(L)

Lower values indicate better models.

## Practical Example: Customer Churn Analysis

```python
# Logistic regression for churn prediction
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Load and prepare data
data = pd.read_csv('customer_data.csv')
X = data[['tenure', 'monthly_charges', 'total_charges']]
y = data['churn']

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Fit model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, predictions))
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Choose appropriate methods** based on data type and research questions
2. **Check assumptions** before applying statistical tests
3. **Use regularization** to prevent overfitting
4. **Validate models** using proper techniques
5. **Interpret results** in context of the problem
