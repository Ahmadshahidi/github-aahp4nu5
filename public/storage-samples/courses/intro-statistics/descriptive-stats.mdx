# Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics help us summarize and understand our data through numerical measures and visualizations. Think of them as tools that give us a "snapshot" of what our data looks like.

## Measures of Central Tendency

These measures tell us where the "center" of our data lies.

### Mean (Average)
The sum of all values divided by the number of values.

**Formula**: $\mu = \frac{\sum x}{n}$

**Example**: Test scores: 85, 90, 78, 92, 88
Mean = $\frac{85 + 90 + 78 + 92 + 88}{5} = \frac{433}{5} = 86.6$

### Median
The middle value when data is arranged in order.

**Example**: 78, 85, **88**, 90, 92
Median = 88

### Mode
The most frequently occurring value.

**Example**: 85, 88, 90, 88, 92, 88
Mode = 88 (appears 3 times)

## Measures of Variability

These measures tell us how spread out our data is.

### Range
The difference between the highest and lowest values.

**Example**: Range = 92 - 78 = 14

### Variance
The average of the squared differences from the mean.

**Formula**: $\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum(x - \mu)^2}{n}$

### Standard Deviation
The square root of the variance. It tells us how much, on average, each data point differs from the mean.

**Formula**: $\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}$

> **Interpretation**: About 68% of data falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean in a normal distribution.

## Data Visualization

### Histograms
Show the distribution of numerical data by grouping values into bins.

### Box Plots
Display the five-number summary:
- Minimum
- First quartile (Q1)
- Median (Q2)
- Third quartile (Q3)
- Maximum

### Scatter Plots
Show the relationship between two numerical variables.

## Real-World Application

Let's say you're analyzing customer satisfaction scores (1-10) for a restaurant:

**Data**: 8, 9, 7, 10, 8, 6, 9, 8, 7, 9

**Analysis**:
- Mean = 8.1
- Median = 8
- Mode = 8 and 9 (bimodal)
- Range = 4
- Standard deviation ≈ 1.2

**Interpretation**: The restaurant has good customer satisfaction (mean > 8), with most scores clustering around 8-9, and relatively low variability.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Mean** is sensitive to outliers; **median** is more robust
2. **Standard deviation** helps us understand data spread
3. **Visualizations** make patterns easier to spot
4. Always consider the **context** when interpreting statistics

## Practice Problems

1. Calculate the mean, median, and mode for: 12, 15, 18, 15, 20, 22, 15
2. If a dataset has a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10, what can you say about values between 40 and 60?
3. When would you prefer median over mean as a measure of central tendency?
