# What is Statistics?

Welcome to your first lesson in statistics! Statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. It's a powerful tool that helps us make sense of the world around us.

## Why Study Statistics?

Statistics is everywhere in our daily lives:

- **Business**: Companies use statistics to understand customer behavior and make strategic decisions
- **Healthcare**: Medical researchers use statistics to test new treatments and understand disease patterns
- **Sports**: Teams analyze player performance and game strategies using statistical methods
- **Government**: Policy makers rely on statistical data to make informed decisions

## Key Concepts

### Population vs Sample

- **Population**: The entire group you want to study
- **Sample**: A subset of the population that you actually observe

> **Example**: If you want to know the average height of all students in your university (population), you might measure the height of 100 randomly selected students (sample).

### Types of Data

1. **Quantitative Data**: Numerical data that can be measured
   - Height, weight, temperature, income
   
2. **Qualitative Data**: Categorical data that describes qualities
   - Gender, color, brand preference

### Descriptive vs Inferential Statistics

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizing and describing data
- **Inferential Statistics**: Making predictions or inferences about a population based on sample data

## Getting Started

In the next sections, we'll dive deeper into:
- Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)
- Measures of variability (range, variance, standard deviation)
- Data visualization techniques
- Probability fundamentals

## Practice Exercise

Think about a question you'd like to answer using data. For example:
- "What's the average commute time for students at my school?"
- "Which social media platform is most popular among teenagers?"

Consider:
1. What is your population of interest?
2. How would you collect a representative sample?
3. What type of data would you need to collect?
